# Apimimic CLI

A command-line interface tool for API mocking and proxying using [Apimimic](https://apimimic.com). This tool allows you to intercept HTTP requests and return mocked responses from Apimimic service and proxy unmocked requests to a local or remotebackend.

## Features

- üîÑ Mock API responses using Apimimic service
- üîÄ Proxy mode for forwarding unmocked requests to local or remote backend
- üåê Configurable listening address and remote API endpoint

## Installation

To install the Apimimic CLI, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Then you can build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available in `target/release/`.

## Usage

### Setting Project Key

You can pre-set your project key by running:

```bash
apimimic set-project YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
```

Or provide it directly when running the server:

```bash
apimimic run --project YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
```

### Starting the Server

Basic usage (starts server on default port 8080):
```bash
apimimic run
```

With custom configuration:
```bash
apimimic run --listen 127.0.0.1:3000 --project YOUR_PROJECT_KEY --server http://localhost:3001
```

### Command Line Options

- `help`: Show help message
- `set-project <key>`: Save the project KEY
- `run`: Start the HTTP server with the following options:
  - `-l, --listen <address>`: Local address to listen on (default: 0.0.0.0:8080)
  - `-r, --remote <url>`: Remote API Mimic URL (default: https://cli.apimimic.com)
  - `-p, --project <key>`: Project KEY
  - `--server <url>`: real api server URL (required if proxy mode is enabled on apimimic.com)

## Configuration

The tool stores configuration in the following location:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\apimimic\apimimic-cli\config\config.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.apimimic.apimimic-cli/config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/apimimic-cli/config.json`

## How It Works

1. The tool starts an HTTP server on the specified address
2. For each incoming request:
   - Forwards the request to the Apimimic service
   - If proxy mode is enabled for the given request and the Apimimic response indicates proxying:
     - Forwards the original request to the specified backend
   - Otherwise, returns the mocked response from Apimimic
